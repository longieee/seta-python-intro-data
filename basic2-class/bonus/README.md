# Backgound on exercise

This exercise simulates a recent issue that I faced in a project. Now is your time to give it a try.

Our fictional pipeline is suddenly breaking after a year of operation. The only information we have is the log inside the folder `mysterious_process_logs`. Your job description is very simple: FIX THE PIPELINE.

## NOTE

- There's a sort of "hidden requirement" for this task. I will not tell you what it is. When we are working in real projects, either with customer or in-house, it is important to be able to see this. This is a sort of "skill" that's very important the higher the positions you have in a team/company
- I've also introduced a very subtle bug inside the code. See if you can spot it.
- This pipeline is intended to run on a DAILY BASIS. When you run this code repeatedly the error will definitely show up every subsequent time you run. Beware of this.
