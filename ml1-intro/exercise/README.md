## Linear regression with gradient descend

Implement the Linear regression model to predict, but rather than using the statistical methods, you will need to implement it with the Gradient Descend algorithm

Coding-wise, the exercise it not difficult. The challenge in the exercise lies within the understanding of the model and the algorithm
